<p align="center">pytwot is a synchronous Python API wrapper for the Twitter API. It is filled with rich features and is very easy to use.</p>

## Installation

### Windows

```bash
py -m pip install pytwot
```

### Linux/MacOS

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytwot
```

## Usage

Before using pytwot you have to setup an application [here](https://apps.twitter.com). For a more comfortable experience, you can create an application inside a project. Most endpoints require the client to have `read`, `write` and `direct_messages` app permissions and elevated access type. For more accessibility you can create a dev environment to support events and other premium endpoints. If you have any questions, please open an issue or ask in the official [pytwot Discord](https://discord.gg/nxZCE9EbVr).

```py
import pytwot

client = pytwot.Client(
    "Your Bearer Token Here!!!", 
    consumer_key="Your consumer key here", 
    consumer_secret="Your consumer secret here", 
    access_token="Your access token here", 
    access_token_secret="Your access token secret here",
) #Before using pytwot, make sure to create an application in https://apps.twitter.com.

client.tweet("Hello world, Hello twitter!") #This requires read & write app permissions also elevated access type.
```

You can check in the `examples` directory for more example code.
